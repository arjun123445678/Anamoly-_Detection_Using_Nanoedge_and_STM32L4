# 🌡️ Real-Time Anomaly Detection using STM32L4 IoT Node + HTS221

This project showcases a real-time anomaly detection application built on the STM32L4 IoT Discovery Kit (B-L475E-IOT01A1). It leverages the onboard HTS221 temperature and humidity sensor to monitor environmental conditions. Using a pre-trained machine learning model generated by NanoEdge AI Studio, the system continuously learns and detects abnormal patterns directly on the MCU, enabling smart, low-power edge intelligence without needing internet or cloud processing.
